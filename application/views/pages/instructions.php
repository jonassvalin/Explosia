        <p>On the top row you will find the CPU cards and on the bottom you have
           your own. Underneath each of your character cards use the selector to
            decide which opponent you want to attack. When you're all done,
            click the "Attack" button and the CPU will automatically attack your
             cards as well.
           <br>
           Your attack strength is calculated as a random number between zero
           and your cards attack strength. Beware, the CPU might not be the most
           clever player, but it has some extra strength to compensate!
